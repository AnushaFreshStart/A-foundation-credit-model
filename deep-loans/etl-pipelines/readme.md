# Deeploans Data Lakehouse ETL Pipeline

This repository hosts the ETL pipelines for creating the Deeploans data lakehouse, where raw data from external providers is processed and stored.

The **Lakehouse Architecture** combines the flexibility of a data lake with the structured data management capabilities of a data warehouse.

## Data Location and Infrastructure
The raw data resides in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket, where it is securely stored before processing. The pipeline leverages **GCP Dataproc Serverless** and **Google Cloud Composer** to automate and manage data transformations across the different layers of the lakehouse.

## Lakehouse Schema

The data lakehouse schema is designed with three layers, each with specific processing and transformation objectives:

1. **Bronze Layer**:
    - Objective: Store a one-to-one copy of the raw data, minimally processed with essential data profiling checks.
    - Transformations: Basic profiling rules are applied, including adding columns to support Slow Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 2.

2. **Silver Layer**:
    - Objective: Cleaned and normalized data, where raw data is transformed to separate dimensions for efficient querying and ML preparation.
    - Transformations: Dimensional normalization and transformations for BI and ML features.
      
3. **Gold Layer**:
    - Objective: Prepare data for business metrics and machine learning models.
    - Transformations: The data is refined for business KPIs or machine learning features.
    - Tools:
        - BI and Analytics: Processed with Looker Studio for dashboard and plot preparation.
        - Machine Learning: Further processed using Dataproc Serverless or DataFlow for ML feature engineering.
     

## Data Profiling Stages
Two levels of data profiling ensure data quality and integrity before advancing data to subsequent layers:

- *Bronze-Level Profiling*: Ensures basic data quality checks for raw data before storage in the Bronze layer.
  Key rules include:
   - Ensuring primary key uniqueness and completeness
   - Verifying table and column integrity (e.g., no NULL values in required fields)
   - Confirming the presence of essential columns
- *Silver-Level Profiling*: Applied to Silver layer data before allowing it to be processed in the Gold layer. These rules vary based on asset class and file type.

## Asset Classes

The asset classes covered are: 

-  SME loans
-  Residential Mortgages
-  Consumer Lending 
-  Auto loans 
-  Exotic private debt (Data Centers)


## Exotic Templates

A new **exotic** family is available at:

- `etl-pipelines/exotic/data-centers/`

This pipeline provides an MVP for ingesting and transforming data-center facility operating data into junior-note monitoring outputs.

## Data Assumptions

Primary keys for various datasets are based on a combination of unique identifiers:

- Assets: `dl_code` + `Loan ID` (e.g. AS3 for ECB SME Loans Template)
- Collateral: `dl_code` + `Collateral ID` (e.g. CS1 for ECB SME Loans Template)
- Bond Information: `dl_code` + `Report Date` (BS1 for ECB SME Loans Template) + `Issuer` (BS2 for ECB SME Loans Template)
- Amortization: `dl_code` + `AS3` (relevant for SME Loans Templates only)

## Running the ETL Pipeline

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository: Ensure that **gcloud CLI** is installed and set up to access the `your project_id` project on GCP.

2. Edit Configuration: Modify the `Makefile` if the data is located in a different GCS bucket or folder.

3. Build and Deploy:
   - Run the following command to prepare the code and upload it to GCP:
     ```bash
     > make setup && make build
     ```
4. Start the workflow
   - Upload the relevant Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) file to Google Cloud Composer.
   - Start the workflow in two stages to manage parallelism and avoid file write conflicts:
     - **Stage 1**: Run the DAG to perform Bronze-level profiling and data generation. Set the `max_active_tasks` parameter to a value greater than 1 to enable parallel task execution.
     - **Stage 2**: Modify the DAG to process only Silver-level data generation. Set `max_active_tasks` to 1 to prevent concurrent writes on the parquet files.
    

## FAQ
**What is the primary technology stack?**
Python for scripting the ETL jobs and Cloud Platform (Storage, Dataproc,  BigQuery)

**Basic specs on throughput capabilities:** Apache Spark on GCP Dataproc allows GBs to TBs per job. GKE allows dynamic scaling of nodes and parallelized jobs

**Specs on CI/CD capabilities:** Google Cloud Composer,​​ no fully automated CI/CD pipeline in place

**Main assumptions about the data injection layer:** Data ingested from external sources following ECB / ESMA data templates and stored in GC Storage. From Bigquery into GKE pods and Angular UI for end-to-end automation

**Field mappings maintenance:** Manually within the ETL code. Feature engineering and mappings are managed directly within the script (utils)

**Data validation and business rules logic:** Custom script imports various validation schemas (with business logic), which define the rules for validating different types of loan data (e.g collaterals, amortization profile etc.

**Multi-tenant support:** Achieved through data partitioning in BigQuery or storage isolation in Google Cloud Storage. Each tenant's data can be processed separately in isolated data environments (datasets, buckets) with access control managed via Google IAM roles. Each tenant can have their own set of resources (pods, services) managed in separate namespaces, ensuring isolation at the infrastructure level.
